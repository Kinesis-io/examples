Welcome to Kinesis
======================

A native development framework which enables you to write native gesture based applications with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Why Kinesis?

Kinesis leverages web technologies developers already know best HTML/CSS/JavaScript. So you can reuse your existing code and existing team to build gesture enabled applications on top of [Kinect for Windows SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/).

What Phonegap does for mobile application development, Kinesis does for Kinect application development.

### JavaScript-SDK

Our JavaScript development framework gives access to Gesture Recognition like hand swipe, multiple joint tracking, jumping, body movement; And Speech Recognition to provide actionable keywords. 

### Kinect Simulator

Now you don't need a Kinect to start development on your project. Install our [Kinesis Simulator](/simulators) and you are on your way.

Also, you can do your development on a mac using our simulator. (Coming soon)

### Native App Launcher (Coming Soon)

A one-click full screen application launcher to start quick and easy. Download [http://kinesis.io/app_launcher/download]()

### Everything You Need

Together, these elements provide everything you need to run a gesture enabled web application through Kinect.
